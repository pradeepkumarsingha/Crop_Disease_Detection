# ðŸŒ± Crop Disease Detection using CNN

A deep learning project that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, this project allows users to upload a leaf image and get the predicted crop type, disease, and confidence score through an interactive web app.

This model is trained on **30,000 leaf images of major crops from Odisha**, achieving a **training accuracy of 95%** and **validation accuracy of 88%**.

## Features

- Detects multiple crop diseases from leaf images  
- Shows **predicted crop type** and **disease**  
- Displays **confidence score** of the prediction  
- Interactive **Streamlit GUI**  
- Trained on **major crops of Odisha**  
- Uses **CNN** for accurate disease detection  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning)  
- OpenCV (Image Processing)  
- Streamlit (Web App GUI)  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Pickle (Saving Label Encoder)
